        <p>Federal websites are, by law, designed to be accessible to everyone – individuals who are visually impaired, hearing impaired, or have mobility issues – and we want you to help us develop shareable solutions to some digital accessibility problems facing Government and users today.</p>
        <p>This Accessibility Hackathon will feature experts discussing this work, networking opportunities, and the opportunity to make a real difference on these issues.</p>
        <p>Everyone is welcome, and we have all kinds of cool stuff planned, for experienced developers to total newbies...</p>         <p><em>Registration has closed.</em></p>
